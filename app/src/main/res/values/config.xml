         we change the canvas opacity so libhwui doesn't call glClear on our surface, and then we
         draw the scrim with SRC to overwrite the whole buffer, which saves us a layer of overdraw.
         However, SRC performs poorly on some devices, where it is more efficient to
         glClear + SRC_OVER, in which case this flag should be disabled. -->
